05169: \E3* .../

10275: \E7And believe me^1,&it's not like I&wasn't trying./
10276: \E3I wasted weeks with&that stupid king^1,&vainly hoping I would&feel something./

10278: I ran away from&home./
10279: Eventually^1, I reached&the RUINS./

10283: \E6Ha ha.../%%
10284: \E1I realized those two&were useless./

10288: ^1, you might&not believe this.../

10290: \E7Not in a world&without love./
10291: \E6Not in a world&without you./
10292: \E1So.../

10299: \E9If you don't have&a SOUL^1, what happens&when you...?/
10300: \E1Something primal&started to burn&inside me./
10301: "No^1," I thought^1.&"I don't want to&die!"/
10302: Then I woke up./
10303: Like it was all&just a bad dream./
10304: I was back at the&garden./
10305: \E0Back at my&"save point."/%%
10306: Interested^1, I decided&to experiment./
10307: Again and again^1, I&brought myself to&the edge of death./
10308: At any point^1, I&could have let this&world continue on&without me./
10309: But as long as I&was determined to&live.../
10310: \E0I could go back./
10311: \E6Amazing^1, isn't it^1,&
10312: \E0I was amazed^1, too./%%
10313: \E1At first^1, I used my&powers for good./
10314: \E0I became "friends"&with everyone./
10315: I solved all their&problems flawlessly./
10316: Their companionship&was amusing.../
10317: \E1For a while. /
10318: \E1As time repeated^1,&people proved&themselves&predictable./
10319: What would this&person say if I&gave them this?/
10320: What would they do&if I said this to&them?/
10321: Once you know the&answer^1, that's it./
10322: That's all they are./%%
10323: \E1It all started&because I was&curious./
10324: \E0Curious what would&happen if I killed&them./
10325: \E2"I don't like this^1,"&I told myself./
10326: \E1"I'm just doing this&because I HAVE to&know what happens./
10327: \E8Ha ha ha..^1.&What an excuse!/
10328: \E9You of all people&must know how&liberating it is to&act this way./

10332: \E1Nowadays^1, even that's&grown tiring./

11557: \E7* Was it foolishness?/

11560: \E7* Well./
11561: \E0* Only you know the&  answer^1, don't you...?/%%
11562: \E2* I know why 
11563: &  climbed the mountain./
11564: \E7* It wasn't for a&  very happy reason./
11565: \E2* Frisk^1.&* I'll be honest with&  you./
11566: \E7 * 
11567:  hated humanity./
11568: \E2* Why they did^1, they&  never talked about&  it./
11569: \E1* But they felt very&  strongly about&  that./%%
11570: \E2* Frisk..^1.&* You really ARE different&  from 
11571: \E0* In fact^1, though you&  have similar^1, uh^1,&  fashion choices.../
11572: * I don't know why I&  ever acted like you&  were the same person./

11577: \E0* You're the type of&  friend I wish I&  always had./
11578: \E7* So maybe I was kind&  of projecting a&  little bit./
11579: \E0* Let's be honest^1.&* I did some weird&  stuff as a flower./%%
11580: \E2* There's one last&  thing I feel like&  I should tell you./
11581: * Frisk^1, when 
11582: &  and I combined our&  SOULs together.../
11583: * The control over our&  body was actually split&  between us./
11584: * They were the one&  that picked up their&  own empty body./
11585: * And then^1, when we&  got to the village.../
11586: \E2* They were the one&  that wanted to.../
11587: \E1* ... to use our full&  power./
11588: \E2* I was the one that&  resisted./
11589: \E7* And then^1, because of&  me^1, we.../
11590: \E1* Well^1, that's why I&  ended up a flower./
11591: * This whole time^1, I've&  blamed myself for&  that decision./
11592: * That's why I adopted&  that horrible view&  of the world./
11593: * "Kill or be killed."/
11594: \E7* But now..^1.&* After meeting you.../
11595: \E0* Frisk^1, I don't regret&  that decision anymore./
11596: \E4* I did the right&  thing./
11597: * If I killed those&  humans.../
11598: * We would have had to&  wage war against all&  of humanity./
11599: \E0* And in the end^1,&  everyone went free^1,&  right?/
11600: \E7* I still feel kind&  of sad knowing how&  long it took.../
11601: \E0* ... so maybe it&  wasn't a perfect&  decision./
11602: * But you can't regret&  hard choices your&  whole life^1, right?/
11603: \E7* Well^1, not that I&  have much of a life&  left./

16675: \E3* It was the monthly address at&  the castle^1, and the queen&  was giving her part on&  current events./
16676: \E0* After finishing her update^1,&  she moved to pass the&  microphone to the king./
16677: \E3* However^1, she didn't realize&  the microphone was still in&  her hands when she said:/
16678: \E2* "Your turn^1, Fluffybuns."/
16679: \E0* The audience burst into&  laughter./
16680: \E2* Realizing what she had said^1,&  she started laughing too./
16681: \E0* After a few moments^1, the&  king held up his arms^1.&* The crowd grew silent./
16682: \E3* He leaned towards the&  microphone^1, expression..^1.&* Stern./
16683: \E0* "Dear citizens.^1"&* "Thank you for coming&  here today."/
16684: \E3* "I..^1. King Fluffybuns..."/
16685: \E2* And the rest is history./%%
16686: \E2* What's that^1?&* You want me to repeat myself?/
16687: \E0* Heck no^1!&* Your eyes still work..^1.&* Go read a book or something^1!&* Wahaha!/%%
16688: \E0* Oh yeah..^1.&* The prophecy./
16689: \E4* Legend has it, an 'angel' who has&  seen the surface will descend&  from above and bring us freedom./
16690: \E3* Lately^1, the people have been&  taking a bleaker outlook.../
16691: \E4* Callin' that winged circle the&  'Angel of Death.'/
16692: \E3* A harbinger of destruction^1,&  waitin' to 'free' us from&  this mortal realm.../
16693: * In my opinion^1, when I see&  that little circle.../
16694: \E2* I jus' think it looks neat^1!&* Wahaha!/%%
16695: \E0* That emblem actually predates&  written history^1.&* The original meaning has been&  lost to time.../
16696: \E4* All we know is that the&  triangles symbolize us monsters&  below^1, and the winged circle&  above symbolizes.../
16697: \E3* Somethin' else./
16698: \E0* Most people say it's the&  'angel^1,' from the prophecy.../%%
16699: \E0* Eh^1?&* You don't know what that is?/
16700: \E1* What are they teaching you&  kids in school nowadays...^1?&*\E2 Wa ha ha!/
16701: \W*\E0 That's the \YDelta Rune^1,\W the&  emblem of our kingdom^1.&* The Kingdom.../
16702: * ... of Monsters./
16703: * Wahaha^1!&* Great name^1, huh^1?&* It's as I always say.../
16704: * Ol' King Fluffybuns can't name&  for beans!/%%
16705: \E3* Eh^1?&* Goat?/
16706: \E2* Actually^1, that reminds me^1.&* Toriel once wore a flower-&  patterned muu-muu... /
16707: \E0* Folks kept saying "nice muu-&  muu" to her^1, but she kept&  thinking they were calling&  her a cow./
16708: \E1* So she never wore it again./
16709: \E3* What was the question again?/
16710: \E0* Oh^1.&* Right^1.&* ASGORE./
16711: \E3* He's a real interesting&  type of monster^1.&* The strongest type of all./
16712: \E0* We call 'em Boss Monsters./
16713: * When they have an offspring^1,&  the SOUL power of the&  parents flows into the&  child.../
16714: * Causing the child to grow&  as the parents age./
16715: \E3* But ASGORE doesn't have a&  child^1.&* So he's been stuck at the&  same age..^1.&* And probably will be forever./
16716: \E1* Huh^1?&* What if the child is a&  human...^1? What?/
16717: \E1* Nah^1. That wouldn't work^1.&* So if ASGORE's your father^1,&  he'll definitely outlive&  you./%%
16718: \E1* I've lived too long to&  be afraid of something&  like you./
16719: \E2* Try it^1, kiddo!/
16720: \E3* ... I know you can't here./
16721: \E1* Wah ha..^1.&* Knowledge like that is&  the only reason I've&  survived so long./%%
16722: * King Fluffybuns^1?&* He's a friendly^1, happy-go-lucky&  kind of guy.../
16723: \E4* If you keep walking around long&  enough^1, you'll probably meet him^1.&*\E0 He loves to walk around and&  talk to people./
16724: \E3* Eh^1?&* Why do I call Dreemurr&  'Fluffybuns?^1'&*\E2 Oh^1, that's a great story!/
16725: \E0* I don't remember it./
16726: * But if you come back much&  later^1, I'm sure I'll have&  remembered by then./%%
16727: \E2* Oh yeah^1!&* Of course^1.&* Toriel was queen^1, and&  Asgore was the king./
16728: \E3* It was tragic when she left./
16729: \E1* Since everyone knew she was&  really the brains behind the&  throne.../
16730: \E0* But it was also just a&  teensy^1, teensy bit relieving^1,&  you know?/
16731: \E3* Those two were really&  insufferable together..^1.&* Nuzzling noses^1, bein' all cute&  n' cuddly in public..^1.&* Embarrassing their children.../
16732: \E0* They were so sweet it&  made me SICK^1.&* Thank god those days are&  over!/%%
16733: \E3* Eh^1? Fight you?/
16734: \E1* Nah..^1. I'm not a hero^1.&* Never was./
16735: \E2* And b'sides..^1.&* These old bones aren't fit&  for fighting anyhoo./
16736: \E3* One attack from you^1, and&  then I'd... well.../
16737: \E2* At least by talking to&  you^1, I've bought enough time&  for some of them to escape./%%
16738: \E0* Undyne^1?&* Yeah^1, she's a local hero&  around here./
16739: \E4* Through grit and determination&  alone^1, she fought her way to&  the top of the Royal Guard./
16740: \E3* Actually^1, she just came through&  here asking about someone who&  looked just like you.../
16741: \E0* I'd watch your back^1, kid^1.&* And buy some items..^1.&* It might just save your hide^1!&* Wa ha ha!/%%
16742: \E0* Undyne^1.&* She's really come a long way&  since she was a little&  urchin./
16743: \E2* I used to be a hero myself^1,&  back in the old days^1.&* Gerson^1, the Hammer of Justice./
16744: \E3* When she was younger^1, Undyne&  would follow me around^1, to&  watch me beat up bad guys.../
16745: \E0* Sometimes she'd even try&  to help!/
16746: \E3* Though^1, most of the time&  the folks she attacked weren't&  bad guys^1.&* It'd be the mailman or&  something like that./
16747: \E2* Anyhoo^1, I appreciated it^1!&* Wah ha ha ha!!!/%%
16748: \E1* I'm not a hero./
16749: \E3* But I know there's someone&  out there./
16750: \E0* Someone who'll never give&  up trying to do the&  right thing^1, no matter&  what./
16751: \E4* There's no prophecy or&  legend 'bout anyone like&  that./
16752: \E3* It's just something I know&  is true./
16753: \E0* That someone like that&  will strike you down./%%

17031: \E6* I'm 19 years old and I've&  already wasted my entire life./%%
17032: \E0* So we're free^1, huh^1?&* Mettaton told us as much./
17033: \E4* Then he told me^1, "don't&  think that means you're&  getting out of work early."/
17034: \E6* Ah..^1. my boss.&* I love that guy./

17042: \E3* Ha^1! Ahahaha!^1! Yes!!^1!&* I won't let you down!!/
17043: \E6* Little buddy..^1. thank you./
17044: * You've brought a tear to the&  eye of this old man./
17045: \E5* So^1, uh^1, where do they&  want to go?/
17046: * They want to hang out at&  the garbage dump./
17047: \E6* Well^1, nowhere to go but&  up^1, right^1, little buddy?/%%
17048: \E5* Well^1?&* Don't keep me waiting^1,&  little buddy!!/%%
17049: \E4* The girls were..^1.&* Talking about me...?/
17050: * They say I should stop acting&  like they owe me.../
17051: \E5* ... and if I want to be&  FRIENDS with them^1, I should&  just..^1. uh^1, try to see&  things from their&  perspective?/
17052: \E4* Wow./
17053: \E6* Poor^1, naive little buddy^1.&* They've brainwashed you./
17054: * "Friendship" is just a hot&  person's way of making you&  their slave./
17055: \E5* So^1, uh^1, what time would&  they wanna hang out?/%%
17056: \E4* Everyone calls me burgerpants&  now./
17057: \E5* But you won't^1, will you^1,&  little buddy?/%%
17058: \E6* So I went out to the alley&  to see those two ladies^1, and&  uh..^1. you know^1, see what'd&  happen next./
17059: \E5* Then my boss^1, uh^1, saw me and&  asked me what I was doing./
17060: \E1* I was so startled^1, the hamburgers&  in my pockets tumbled out&  onto the ground./
17061: \E3* Not wanting to lose face^1,&  I scrambled to pick them up!/
17062: \E3* But^1, as I was leaning over^1,&  the weight of the remaining&  hamburgers.../
17063: \E5* ... caused my pants to fall&  down./
17064: \E4* Then the girls laughed at me./
17065: \E4* Everyone calls me Burgerpants&  now./%%
17066: \E6* Listen^1.&* I like you^1, little buddy^1.&* So I'm gonna save you a lot&  of trouble./
17067: \E3* Never interact with attractive&  people./
17068: \E6* Unless you're "one of them^1,"&  they're just gonna take&  advantage of you./
17069: \E3* Like that time those two&  chicks asked me to sneak them&  some glamburgers./
17070: \E6* And I^1, naive teenager that&  I was^1, said yes to them./
17071: \E4* Bad idea./%%
17072: \E4* Those girls?&* The ones who saw my pants&  fall down?/
17073: \E5* Well^1, we're all gonna be&  free^1, so I'll never see&  them again^1, at least!/%%
17074: \E4* So we're free now./
17075: \E5* Does that mean my double-&  date is cancelled...?/
17076: \E5* I know^1, it wasn't really&  a..^1.&* A date./
17077: \E6* Here's a trick^1, little buddy^1:&* Lie to yourself all the time^1.&* It makes you feel better./%%
17078: \E4* Well^1, Mettaton didn't tell me&  I HAD to work, I guess.../
17079: \E3* But that's the thing^1!&* Sometimes he doesn't even&  call me into work until&  halfway into my shift!/
17080: \E4* If I don't play it safe^1,&  he's going to yell at me./
17081: \E6* Okay^1, maybe "yell" is the&  wrong term./
17082: \E4* It's more like he has this..^1.&* CD album he plays.../
17083: \E5* That's entirely full of&  songs about how bad I am&  at my job./%%
17084: \E5* Let's not talk about this./%%
17085: \E1* Why do people find him so&  attractive??/
17086: \E3* He's literally just a freaking&  rectangle./
17087: * You know^1, one time^1, I bought&  one of those^1, uh^1, kits&  online..^1. to.../
17088: \E5* Uh^1, make yourself more&  rectangular./
17089: \E5* They don't work./%%
17090: \E3* God^1, have you even looked&  around^1?&* This place is a labyrinth of&  bad choices./
17091: * And every time we try to change&  something for the better^1, he&  vetoes it and says "that's not&  how they do it on the&  surface."/
17092: \E1Oh! Right!/
17093: \E3* Humans are always eating&  hamburgers made of SEQUINS&  AND GLUE./%%
17094: \E5* When I first came to Hotland^1,&  it was my dream to work&  with Mettaton./
17095: \E3* Well^1, be careful what you&  wish for^1, little buddy!/%%
17096: \E3* Don't tell anyone this^1, Little&  Buddy./
17097: \E4* (Because they'll make fun&  of me,)/
17098: \E5* But I..^1.&* I feel like I played a hand in&  everyone getting free&  somehow./
17099: \E1* Even if it was just&  working this awful job.../
17100: \E5* I think I did something!/
17101: \E3* I don't know if it's true^1,&  but I'll believe it anyway!/%%
17102: \E3* Huh?&* Everyone else is DEAD?/
17103: \E5* Does that mean I don't&  have to work today?/
17104: \E6* God^1.&* That it were true^1,&  little weirdo^1.&* That it were true./%%
17105: \E3* Future^1?&* WHAT future^1?&* Nothing down here EVER&  changes./
17106: \E4* I'll probably be trapped&  at this stupid job forever./
17107: \E3* But wait^1!&* There's one thing that keeps&  me going!/
17108: * If ASGORE gets just one&  more SOUL^1, we'll finally get&  to go to the surface!/
17109: * It'll be a brand new world^1!&* There's gotta be a second&  chance out there for me^1!&* For everyone!/
17110: \E6* So stay strong^1, little buddy^1.&* When I make it big^1, I'll&  keep you in mind./%%
17111: \E3* Little buddy^1!&* There's a brand new world&  out there waiting&  for us./
17112: \E6* I'm sure with my (ahem)&  qualifications^1, it won't&  be long before I'm a&  famous movie star.../
17113: \E4* Or^1, maybe I'll just end up&  flipping burgers again./
17114: \E3* But it's as I say^1!&* Nowhere to go but up^1!&* Literally^1, in this case!/%%
17115: \E6* Sorry^1, little weirdo^1.&* Threats won't work on me./
17116: * I can't go to hell^1.&* I'm all out of vacation&  days./%%
17117: \E0* I'm sorry^1, (Ha ha) it's against&  the rules to talk to customers&  who haven't bought anything./%%
17118: \E1* What^1?&* Why do you keep trying to talk&  to me?/
17119: \E1* I'll get in trouble if I get&  chummy with the customers./
17120: \E0* Sorry./

17358: * W-well^1, I haven't either^1,&  but I don't want her to&  notice me over here.../%%

17360: * ....../%%
17361: * That lady over there&  seems happy today./
17362: * Don't know why^1, but it's&  sending shivers down my&  spine.../%%
17363: * This town doesn't have a&  mayor./

17365: * Thaaaaaat's politics!/%%
17366: * Politics./%%
17367: * What if I ran for mayor...?/
17368: * I don't think I would do&  a good job^1, and I hate&  responsibility.../
17369: * But I love politics^1.&* So I might be a perfect&  match./%%
17370: * I heard Dr. Alphys told&  the king and queen the&  awful things she'd done./
17371: * The king felt so bad&  that he didn't know^1.&* He gave her a big hug./

17377: * Where is he...^1?&* I can feel our political&  system crumbling apart.../%%
17378: * Awful teens tormented&  a local monster by decorating&  its tree-like horns./
17379: * So we started giving that&  monster presents to make it&  feel better./
17380: * Now it's a tradition to put&  presents underneath a decorated&  tree./%%
17381: * Guess it was a good thing&  those teens tormented that&  monster...?/%%
17382: * Hmm^1?&* Adjusting the presents is&  my responsibility./
17383: * Nah^1, to be honest^1, I&  just keep looking to see&  if I've gotten one.../%%
17384: * It'll be nice to show humans&  our presents-under-the-tree&  tradition./
17385: * They'll probably be weirded&  out by it./%%
17386: * You know what's cute?/
17387: * Those two married dogs&  always put presents under&  the tree for each other./
17388: * It's always the same^1.&* A single bone./
17389: * But every time^1, they act&  like it's the first time&  they've gotten it./
17390: * Then Papyrus comes to take&  his bones back./
17391: * Anyway^1, where are those&  two...?/%%
17392: * That's strange^1.&* There was a present here&  for Papyrus.../
17393: * Now it's gone^1.&* Did someone steal it?/%%
17394: * We all know the underground&  has problems^1, but we&  smile anyway./
17395: * Why?/
17396: * We can't do anything^1, so&  why be morose about it?/%%
17397: * Smile smile./%%
17398: * PATHETIC HUMAN./

17402: * Oh^1?&* We're free?/
17403: * Finally..^1.&* I'll be able to stop&  smiling./%%
17404: * Just now^1, I felt my smile&  falter for a moment./
17405: * What's wrong?/%%
17406: * Everyone is always laughing&  and cracking jokes^1, trying&  to forget our modern crises.../
17407: * Dreariness^1.&* Crowding^1.&* Lack of sunlight./
17408: * I would join them^1, but I'm&  just not very funny./%%
17409: * At least I'm not making puns./%%
17410: * Wait^1!&* I've got a joke!/
17411: * Knock knock!/
17412: * ... Uh^1.&* That's all I've thought of./%%
17413: * Looks like I don't have&  to worry about cracking&  jokes anymore./
17414: * I was going to say a joke&  here^1, but I really don't&  have one./%%
17415: * It just feels like..^1.&* Like everything is getting&  worse and worse./%%
17416: * The capital's getting pretty&  crowded^1, so I've heard they're&  going to start moving here./
17417: * Hmmm..^1.&* I don't want to see the&  erasure of our local culture./
17418: * But I definitely want to see&  some city slickers slip onto&  their butts!/%%
17419: * Yeah^1, bring 'em on!/%%
17420: * What will happen to&  Grillby's if everyone&  moves in...?/
17421: * We're gonna have to have&  chairs to the ceiling./%%
17422: * Hey^1! People won't have to&  move in from the city&  anymore!/
17423: * Seems like we won't have&  to lose our local culture./
17424: * ... except we're all moving&  out of here^1, huh./
17425: * Oh well^1. Guess it can't be&  all punk-peaches and punk-&  cream./%%
17426: * ... who knows^1.&* Maybe we'll have room./%%
17427: * Ah^1, to be young again^1.&* The world sure felt boundless./%%
17428: * You like to wander^1.&* You must be young./%%
17429: * Seems like this is the&  beginning of a brand-new^1,&  boundless world.../
17430: * Wah-ha^1!&* This adventurous spirit^1!&* I'm like a kid again!/
17431: * And my children are like..^1.&* Double-children./%%
17432: * I've sent the kids inside./
17433: * It feels unsafe here today./%%

17439: * Now we can play Monsters&  and Humans with REAL humans!/%%
17440: * You aren't gonna make me&  be the human again^1, are you?/%%
17441: * Can we PLEASE play something&  else...?/%%
17442: * Hmmm..^1.&* When humans play Monsters&  and Humans.../

17535: * Hmmm..^1.&* Isn't human food different&  from monster food?/

17537: * And when you eat it^1, it&  passes all the way through&  your whole body./
17538: * Disgusting./
17539: * I'd love to try it sometime./%%
17540: * And I've heard they have&  things called bathrooms./%%
17541: * To a human^1, monster food&  would be very interesting./
17542: * As soon as you eat it^1, it&  converts perfectly into&  energy./
17543: * ... that makes me wonder^1.&* How do humans do it?/

17572: * Where's Sans..^1.&* He's supposed to give me&  a pat on the head.../%%
17573: * She hasn't been responding&  to our letters.../
17574: * Maybe it's because we let&  Doggo write them all./%%
17575: * I was hoping Sans came in&  to give me a pat on the&  head./

17592: * He'll just win!!!/%%
17593: * Sometimes the others like to&  prank me^1. They sit still&  so I can't see them./
17594: * They must be here^1, playing a&  joke on me./
17595: * I'll just wait until one of&  them admits it.../%%

17741: * Even if I was having a bad&  day^1, we'll always give each&  other a thumbs-up^1, and.../

17763: * But there's a limit to the&  things you can do^1.&* Accepting this is healthy./
17764: * Take my neighbor's blessing^1!&* And consider this blessing&  for anything you like!/%%
17765: * I wanted to tell you about&  my neighbor's daughter./
17766: * But you walked right by me&  before I could tell you./

17773: * Mettaton hasn't made a&  performance for more&  than five minutes.../
17774: * What's happening...^1?&* Can you explain it?/%%
17775: * I'm the resort comedian.&* I'm very funny^1.&* People laugh at my jokes./

17792: * It's tearing my family apart./%%
17793: * My son..^1.&* He was always making these&  weird ice puns./
17794: * I hated them^1, so he ran&  away from home.../
17795: * I think I should try to&  patch things up with him./
17796: * Have you seen him^1?&* Have you seen my son?/%%
17797: * Oh..^1.&* When you hug me^1, I feel..^1.&* So spicey./%%

17806: * Since the CORE is always&  re-arranging^1, it was like&  a game trying to find it./
17807: * Now it is my special place^1.&* It is nice for cooking s'mores&  and things like that./%%
17808: * We were hired by Mettaton&  to destroy you./

17810: * No hard feelings./%%
17811: * Zzzzzzz.../
